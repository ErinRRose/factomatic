# Facto-matic

Facto-matic is a React/Rails application that gives you a random fact that you can vote on whether or not you feel it is true or false.  This is my final project for Flatiron School.

Each fact has a true or false button and if it has been voted on before will show a percentage of those that felt it was true.  When either button is selected it will give you a new fact.  

## Getting Started

 To install , follow these steps: First you will need to clone the backend here. Install all required gems in the Gemfile by running `bundle install`. Create your database by running `rails db:migrate`. Run `rails s -p 3001` in the terminal to run the API server for the saved votes. Open the port in the browser (rails defaults to port 3000). To exit the server run `ctrl + c` in the terminal. In the terminal, you can run: `npm start`, runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
